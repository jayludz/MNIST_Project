A feedforward neural network is coded from scratch to classify images from the MNIST database of handwritten digits. The Training Data and Test Data folders contain the training and test datasets, respectively. However, the MNIST database of handwritten digits is also available as one of the demo datasets in the Keras library. The code is contained in the **MNIST_project.ipynb** notebook.
